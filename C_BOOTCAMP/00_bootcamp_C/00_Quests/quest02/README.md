# Welcome to Quest02
***
Quest 02 treated pointers in C programming.
It treated not only the pointers but also  void function and calling them in the main function,
also the inbuilt libraries for work working faster and smoother in c programming.
## Task
To be able to undertand each task  to be solved and also the concepts or syntax that should be employed
i solving each of the problems. Each of the tasks are uniquely fashioned to address some 
important aspects of C programming. Thereby facilitating the learning of key concepts

## Description
First, i read and understood every given task then figure out the concepts needed to be learnt to 
solve the tasks. after the concepts are understood, they are read up and then a psudocode is
generated for clarity which enable easy problem breakdown and solution.
## Installation
No installation is needed for the solution to be viewed. However, to correctly run the solutions,
one must have a compiler intalled in their local machine to be able to run the programme.
Also, aditionally for ease of codding in c, some deburgers can be installed along side for easy debugging.

## Usage
Just get the correct source code and make sure you have all the necessary instalations made 
that would support the compilation and running of a c file. Once these are in place, anyone can copy
the source code and run them on their lacal machine to see the reults of each solution.


### The Core Team
This project was handled by Precious Oranye.
Precious Oranye is a junior software engineer who is currently undergoing
an upskilling in software engineering in OGTL. This project is one of the 
tasks to be solved in the programme

# Welcome to Quest04
Quest04 is presents codding challenges that require the knowledge of c range, strdup,
printing array using putstr function, counting and string od array and returning length,
joining array of strings and making a spaceship simulation using some predefined cordinates.

## Task
Problems to be solved include:Reproduction of the behavior of strdup from man strdup;
Displaying the content of an array of strings using putstr function;
Counting the size of each elements in an array by  receiving a string array 
and returning an array with the length of each strings;
Joining the string from array are joined with a separator, proding one word per line; and finally
Making a spaceship simulation using some predefined cordinates.

## Description
reading up the relevant subjects for clearrer understanding of the problem.
Then reading each problem and understanding them enough to produce a psuedocode
that would serve as a guide towards finding solutions.
With these, each problem is tacked and successfully resolved

## Installation
No installation is needed. just have a C compiller installed in your local computer
and the files can be run. You will get to access all the files and run them to see how they behave
or the results they produce.

## Usage
This is a training project used to expose learners to the major concepts in C programming.
It covers certain aras in C programming. Hense, solving a task would mean an understanding
of the concepts needed to solve such problem.

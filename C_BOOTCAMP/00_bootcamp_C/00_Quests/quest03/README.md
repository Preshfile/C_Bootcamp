# Welcome to Quest03
Quest03 0f Arc C bootcamp is focused on C libraries
and how they work. these libraries are called up when some specific functions are needed
or expected to run.

## Task
In this secton, one is expected to create folders with files in which solutions are stored.
The task is to solve the hallenge on each task and test them out for correcness.

## Description
Simply think out the solutions to the problems.
Follow every instruction, read up on every related topic
and attempt the questions. With this one is expected to solve the task.

## Installation
No installation is needed. Just inlude the needed header files for

So if one doesnt have a C compiller, it is expected to intall one to be able to run your
the code sucessfully.
## Usage
The tasks are demanding, hence a guide towards learning c.
This is useful to both new coders and the advanced tech developers.
either ways, its a win situation.

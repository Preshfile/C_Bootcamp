# Welcome to Quest05
Introduction to Quest05
Back to do some shell.

Objective is to be more expert with find and discover -type file option, globing (* replace any characters...) and --exec to be able to run another command. (for example basename :D)
Finally, pipe (|) let's you chain command.

## Task
Description
Exercise: my_count_files

Write a command line that counts and displays the number of regular files
 and directories in the current directory 
and all its sub-directories. It should include ".", the starting directory.

Description
In a file called my_clean place the command line
that will search for all files - in the current directory 
as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by ~, or a name that start and end by #

The command line will print and delete all files found.
Only one command is allowed: no ; or && or other gitaneries.


Description
Write a command line that searches for all file names that end with ".sh" (without quotation marks)
in the current directory and all its sub-directories. 
It should display only the name of files without the extension .sh.

Patch transform a file origin to a fixed file applying the transformation or you can called it patch.

## Description
Read up questions, follow instructions, do research,
attempt the questions, do more research, solve the questions, make it work,
beautify it, commit and push to gitea.

## Installation
No installations needed. Just the necessary integrated enviroment to run the program.
Access to command line is needed to test the solutions.
So also is the shwll knowledge for understanding the profered solutions.

## Usage
Use the command line to run the solutionsq. so a good knowledge of the command line is needed.
So the solutions are useful for counting files, cleaning files,
finding files and patching files.

### The Core Team
The solution was provided by Precious Oranye - a software engineering student
currently undergoing a full stack development program at Qwasar, Silicon Valley.
These tasks are needed to be completed to progress to the next phase of the program.

# Welcome to Quest01
***
Quest01 is focused on c programming language. It's made up of 20 tasks covering basic syntax in c 
like the variables, if, while loop, functions, ASCII...
Solving each of the twenty tasks exposed me to the concepts needed to be learnt in solving the problem.
The tasks are arranged in other of complexity, from the simplest to the more demanding ones.
Therefore going through the tasks is a way of moving up the ladder in C programming.

## Task
The problem is to solve each task as accurately as possible.
Each task is a problem to be solved which in turn exposes one to the desired c concepts.
Hence the challage is learing as you solve each challange.
So by the time a task is successfully solved, one must have learnt the needed concepts while solvinf the problem.

## Description
I was able to solve all the 20 tasks by solving a task at a time.
For each task, instructions are given. so i carefully followed every instruction for eah task.
The concepts in some of the tasks were entirely new. so i googled to learn more about those concepts 
before attempting the question. For some i watced videos while those that still give headaches,
I discussed with my peers, after which my mistakes were clearly pointed out.
Irrespective of the blockers, i still succeeded in solving the tasks with this methods.

## Installation
No installation was needed here, using quasar terminal. but using visual code to first run my code,
i had to install gcc compiler, deburgger and G++.
These enabled my c files to be compiled and run on my local machine.
With this i could test my code in my local machine before sending it for testing on quasar platform.

## Usage
These are tasks that needed solutions and not a program that needs directions 
on how to run. So, each task needs to be solved ad by solving them, one is exposed to
the needed concepts. So its all about solving tasks. Finding solutions to the problems inherent.

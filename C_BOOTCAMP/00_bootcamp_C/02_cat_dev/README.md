# Welcome to My Cat
Welcome to my_cat project.

## Task
Create a program called my_cat which does the same thing as the system's cat command used in the command-line.

Your program should read the content of each files which are received as an argument to your software.
Unlike the real Cat command, you don't have to handle any options.

## Description
To solve the problem, i have to first understand what the cat command does
On Unix-like operating systems, 
the cat command reads data from files,
 and outputs their contents.
 It is the simplest way to display 
 the contents of a file at the command line.

 So having this in mind, i have to build a program with the above functionalities i C.

## Installation
Once you have the right compiler installed on your loal machine,
you call in the my_cat file with the C extention and the file will run.
## Usage
Once you have the right compiler to run the program,
you call in the my_cat file with the C extention and the file will run.
